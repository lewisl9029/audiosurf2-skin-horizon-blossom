# Horizon Blossom skin for Audiosurf 2

[![Horizon Blossom Video](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/455236878696537752/BFE76C8D31A336D088E95AA2BB4381395837FDC9/)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHxSqulPnVc)

Horizon Blossom (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667294066) is an alternate version of my previous skin, Horizon (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=464936377).

The overall atmosphere is about the same as the original Horizon skin, but some parts of it are drastically different, so I decided to publish Horizon Blossom as a new skin rather than as an update to Horizon, since some people may prefer the old Horizon aesthetic (I personally like Horizon Blossom a lot more).

Mod used in the video and screenshots above is my Mono Legend Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194274009 

The code and assets are available on GitHub if you'd like to contribute changes or make a fork: https://github.com/lewisl9029/audiosurf2-skin-horizon-blossom

Enjoy!
